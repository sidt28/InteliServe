      <h1 class="w3-center">About Unified Data</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large">Our team aims at giving a viable solution  to the - “Unified Data verification” problem statement by building a latest, versatile and robust website platform for the various police departments with the help of latest emerging technologies so that they can access the citizen data via a  fast, secure and user-friendly interface. 
        Our idea can be divided into three different unique parts. The first distinguishing feature of our website will be its blockchain based backend. Instead of using traditional database systems, we will be integrating the frontend with a blockchain containing the citizen data, making the platform decentralized, much more secure<span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey">secure</span> and transparent.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">In order to make the user interface user friendly, we will integrate an AI chatbot which will help the user in interacting with the website easily. Additionally, we will include a separate section called fast access which will act as resource from where we can directly use the most frequently used and recently used services.We will assign roles according to the ranks of police officers, thus adding on to the strong security provided by the blockchain.</p>

      <h4>Distributed Ledger</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">An electronic ledger is essentially a database containing all transactions that are constantly updated. It is composed of multiple blocks and these blocks are linked together into a chain using cryptography.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Peer-to-peer network</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">A Peer-to-peer network (P2P) is a decentralized model to communicate between many participants also known as peer nodes without any central servers or dependence on any other nodes. A P2P network allows each party to act as both a client and a server</p><br>
    
      <h4>Cryptography</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">This component ensures the security, integrity and verification of the information in the ledger or the information transmitted between the nodes. By building on a foundation of mathematics (especially probability theory) along with knowledge of game theory, cryptography has come up with encryption methods that are impossible to break.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Using these features we will create a light-weight, easy to use yet advanced and secure website for police departments based on roles assigned to a specific account and will help in accessing citizen data much more efficiently.</p><br>
